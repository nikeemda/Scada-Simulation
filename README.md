## SCADA System Simulation
This project simulates a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. 
The simulation generates random temperature and pressure readings, displays them on a web interface, and logs the data to a chart for historical visualization.

# Features
- Real-time Temperature and Pressure Readings: The application simulates real-time data for temperature and pressure.
- High Temperature Alert: An alert is displayed when the temperature exceeds the users defined limit.
- Historical Chart: Displays a historical chart of temperature and pressure readings since the simulation started.
- Start and Stop Simulation: Buttons to start and stop the data simulation.
# Technologies Used
- Backend: Python with Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Charting Library: Plotly.js
